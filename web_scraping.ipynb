      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "HopeWell is the largest nonprofit provider of foster care in Massachusetts and Connecticut, serving approximately 1000 foster youth annually through a comprehensive, youth-centered and trauma-informed approach. Through innovative solutions such as My First Place™, an education and employment program that provides safe, stable housing, and case management support for youth who have aged out of foster care, and with collaborative partnerships among stakeholders in government, health care, philanthropy, business, and social justice, HopeWell is driving the systems change urgently needed to raise the standards of the foster care experience so that every child can reach their potential in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "ABOUT THE JOB \n",
      "HopeWell seeks an Education Director to strengthen existing partnerships and build new ones with leaders in education, child welfare, and health care to close the opportunity gap foster youth experience from preschool through high school. The Education Director will lead, launch, and grow our new program, RISE: Readiness, Inquiry, Scholarship, Education. RISE provides intensive, long-term, one-on-one tutoring and educational support for foster youth that also addresses social, emotional, and cognitive needs. Unlike traditional tutoring programs, RISE tutors are paired with students, not schools, so tutoring and support remains consistent throughout the four to eight changes of home placements and schools that most foster youth experience through age 18. With a deep commitment to education, child welfare, and social justice, the Education Director will bring an entrepreneurial mindset to the challenges of launching a new program and growing it statewide and beyond. A strategic, creative, and innovative leader and thinker, the Education Director will bring proven experience to the work of building and managing programs and teams from the ground up. \n",
      "\n",
      "The RISE program will start as a pilot in the fall of 2021, in or near the Greater Boston area. The Education Director will be responsible for getting the program off the ground, using data to flexibly and effectively improve the program, and ultimately growing the program from the pilot phase to full implementation. In the coming years, we intend to grow to implement RISE across Massachusetts and Connecticut, and to eventually partner with affiliate organizations across the country to adapt and implement RISE in their local communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "While High Impact Tutoring (often called High Dosage Tutoring or HDT) programs have recently demonstrated excellent outcomes data for the general population, they often don’t meet the unique needs of youth in foster care. We are currently engaging in an intensive discovery sprint to develop an evidence-informed, new program that is tailored to respond to these unique needs. As such, there will be a lot to learn once the program launches in order to most effectively close the achievement gap. The Education Director will be engaged in a continuous cycle of collecting and analyzing data, and using learnings from the program outcomes data to hone the program\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an exciting opportunity to lead a growing team to transform what is possible for youth in foster care. We are seeking an entrepreneurial and innovative leader who is passionate about education, child welfare, and social justice and is enthusiastic about the idea of piloting, strengthening, and growing a brand new education program that delivers real results. This position requires an experienced professional whose alignment with HopeWell’s mission and this new initiative is matched with strong leadership, sound judgement in the face of complex challenges, and a proven track record of successfully managing programs and teams. The Education Director will thrive on strategic thinking and will excel at communication and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders. This individual will have the strong ability and desire to work well BIPOC youth.\n",
